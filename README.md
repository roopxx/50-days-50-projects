# 50 Projects in 50 Days

Welcome to the "50 Projects in 50 Days" challenge by [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/)! This GitHub repository is where I'll be documenting my journey to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a diverse range of projects over the course of 50 days. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started or an experienced developer looking to refine your skills, you're welcome to join me in this challenge.

## Introduction

In this challenge, I'll be working on 50 different projects, with each project focusing on a specific aspect of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to keep each project small and manageable, allowing me to learn and practice one concept at a time. By the end of this challenge, I expect to have a solid understanding of web development fundamentals and be ready to tackle more complex projects.

## How It Works

Here's how I plan to approach this challenge:

- Each day, I'll select a new project idea from the course section.
- I'll create a separate directory in this repository for each project, naming it according to the day (e.g., `Day 01: Project 1`).
- Inside each project directory, I'll include the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- I'll follow the project instructions and aim to complete it within a day.
- I'm also excited to add my own creative touches to each project.

## Project Table

Here's the table of the 50 projects I'll be working on:

| Project            | Status | Link                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Expanding Cards | âœ…     | [View Project](https://expanding-cards-roopxx.vercel.app/) |
| 2. Progress Steps  | âœ…     | [View Project](https://progress-steps-roopxx.vercel.app/)  |

(Note: I'll update the table, one for each day of the challenge.)

## Getting Started

To get started with this challenge, here are the steps I'll follow:

1. I'll clone this repository to my local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roopxx/50-projects-in-50-days.git
```

2. I'll create a new directory for each project using the format `DayXX : Project Name`, where X is the day number.

3. Inside each project directory, I'll create the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

4. I'll start working on the project for the day, following the provided project instructions.

5. After completing each project, I'll commit my changes to my repository.

6. I'll push my changes to GitHub to keep a record of my progress.

7. I'll repeat this process for each day's project.

I'm excited to embark on this journey of learning and growth! ðŸš€
