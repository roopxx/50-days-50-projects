# 50 Projects in 50 Days

Welcome to the "50 Projects in 50 Days" challenge by [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/)! This GitHub repository is where I'll be documenting my journey to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a diverse range of projects over the course of 50 days. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started or an experienced developer looking to refine your skills, you're welcome to join me in this challenge.

## Introduction

In this challenge, I'll be working on 50 different projects, with each project focusing on a specific aspect of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to keep each project small and manageable, allowing me to learn and practice one concept at a time. By the end of this challenge, I expect to have a solid understanding of web development fundamentals and be ready to tackle more complex projects.

## How It Works

Here's how I plan to approach this challenge:

- Each day, I'll select a new project idea from the [Project List](#project-list) section.
- I'll create a separate directory in this repository for each project, naming it according to the day (e.g., `Day 01: Project 1`).
- Inside each project directory, I'll include the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- I'll follow the project instructions and aim to complete it within a day.
- I'm also excited to add my own creative touches to each project.
